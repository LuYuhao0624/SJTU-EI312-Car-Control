Car control in Android.
## Issues or Potential Bugs
*If you fix any of them, please change the "UNFIXED" to "FIXED" in the item.*
1. (UNFIXED) The minimum API level of one of the project (I cannot remember which) is upgraded to 24 and needs to be downgraded.
2. (UNFIXED, NOT URGENT) Appear on WYH's phone. First enter Absolute Control, then enter another control will cause the program (controller) collapse (probably due to Issue 1).
3. (UNFIXED, NOT URGENT) Appear on WYH's phone. Enter Gravity Control, then enter another control. The toast of Gravity Control still shows up (probably due to Issue 1).
## Future Functions
*Placed in importance descending order.*
1. Synchronous Steering (the car direction stays the same with the controller direction).
2. Programmable Absolute Control.
## Notice
Final evaluation ends on Friday, Week 16 (Dec. 28).
